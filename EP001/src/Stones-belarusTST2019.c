    <PROBLEM>
    (Belarus/TST- 2019) 1019 stones are placed into two non-empty boxes. Each second Alex chooses a box with an even amount of stones and shifts half of these stones into another box. Prove that for each k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1018, at some moment there will be a box with exactly k stones.

    Solution 01: Brute Force.
